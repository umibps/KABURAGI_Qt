But since run-time usage of plugins cannot be detected, there could be false positives, as your application will depend on any plugins that are potential dependencies. If you want to minimize the size of your APK, it's possible to override the automatic detection using the ANDROID_DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENCIES variable. This should contain a list of all Qt files which need to be included, with paths relative to the Qt install root. Note that only the Qt files specified here will be included. Failing to include the correct files can result in crashes. It's also important to make sure the files are listed in the correct loading order. This variable provides a way to override the automatic detection entirely, so if a library is listed before its dependencies, it will fail to load on some devices."
